SHINE ON YOUR CRAZY DIAMOND I-V
_______________________________

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond
You were caught on the crossfire of childhood and stardom, blown on the steel breeze
Come on you target for faraway laughter
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision, rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!


WELCOME TO THE MACHINE
______________________

Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
Where have you been? It's alright we know where you've been
You've been in the pipeline, filling in time
Provided with toys and 'Scouting for Boys'
You bought a guitar to punish your ma
And you didn't like school
And you know you're nobody's fool
So welcome to the machine

Welcome my son
Welcome to the machine
What did you dream?  It's all right, we told you what to dream
You dreamed of a big star, he played a mean guitar
He always ate in the Steak Bar. He loved to drive in his Jaguar
So welcome to the machine


HAVE A CIGAR
____________

Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go fly high
You're never gonna die
You're gonna make it if you try
They're gonna love you

Well I've always had a deep respect, and I mean that most sincerely
The band is just fantastic, that is really what I think
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it "Riding the Gravy Train"

We're just knocked out
We heard about the sellout
You gotta get an album out
You owe it to the people
We're so happy we can hardly count

Everybody else is just green
Have you seen the chart?
It's a helluva start
It could be made into a monster if we all pull together as a team

And did we tell you the name of the game, boy?
We call it "Riding the Gravy Train"


WISH YOU WERE HERE
__________________

So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skies from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have you found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here


SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND VI-IX
________________________________

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, and sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child
You winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion
And shine
